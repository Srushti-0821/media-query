            <p>Recently I developed a Patang Hotel's website using HTML5 and CSS3 language.
                It gracefully rotates 221 feet above the ground, on the banks of the Sabarmati River, while offering
                a panoramic view of both old and new Ahmedabad.The restaurant is named Patang, literally a "fighter
                kite" in Gujarati language. It was designed by an architect Hasmukh Patel.[3][4][5] The restaurant and
                the adjoining Chinubhai Centre, a commercial complex, were built in 1980–1984 at a cost of approximately
                ₹1.25 crore (equivalent to ₹20 crore or US$2.3 million in 2023).
